As a user, please be aware that the words are at times used by Clients ‘loosely’ but in some instances legal regulations applicable to each are very specific and the onus is on users of the Platform to research and abide by applicable regulations. See a widely used definition below.</p><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor" id="what-is-a-locum"></a><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="hash-link" href="#what-is-a-locum" title="Direct link to heading">#</a>What is a Locum?</h3><p>A locum, or locum tenens, is a person who temporarily fulfills the duties of another; the term is especially used for healthcare professionals.  For example, a locum tenens physician is a physician who works in the place of the regular physician when that physician is absent, or when a hospital or practice is short-staffed. These professionals are still governed by their respective regulatory bodies, despite the transient or freelance nature of their positions.</p><p>The Locum enters into a contract directly with the Client in an ‘Booking‘ for Locum Services and the contractual relationship is governed by the terms of that contract (Booking) but may also be subject to prevailing, applicable Independent Contractor and Labour Laws if such arrangement falls within the scope of an employer/employee relationship and about which Shift&#x27;M makes no representations and gives no guidance. The nature of the working relationship between Locum and Client is determined by the actual circumstances that exist between them and applicable laws.</p><p>Locums may work with multiple Clients on a per-Shift basis, but more generally they work with one company at a time (exclusively) for a longer and specified period (the ‘contract’) and are paid by the hour. They may be contracting themselves out, and thus reporting their own taxes or they may be on the Client’s payroll, with the Client deducting pay-as-you-go taxes where required.</p><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor" id="are-locums-employees"></a><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="hash-link" href="#are-locums-employees" title="Direct link to heading">#</a>Are Locums, Employees?</h3><p>The following should not be regarded in any way as legal or other advice. Users of Shift&#x27;M must conduct own research and consult own advisers on all aspects of issues related to employer / employee relationships and related legal requirements. Shift&#x27;M does not make any representations in this regard and takes no responsibility for any reliance on any other information provided in relation to employment and employment law.</p><p>Applicable local law (case law and legislation) will determine whether Locums and Independent Contractors are deemed to be employees of the Client or not, with the associated rights and obligations of employer and employee. Further, such relationships will determine whether the Client is obligated to deduct pay-as-you-earn taxes and other applicable levies from Locum revenues.</p><p>Where Locums earn more than the statutory benchmark minimum earnings (different per country and region) the applicable law is more lenient in terms of not deeming Independent Contractors to be employees, but Locums can still be deemed employees if certain criteria are met.</p><p>By using Shift&#x27;M, Locums contract directly with Clients in respect of their Services. Shift&#x27;M is merely the facilitating platform that enables Clients to view Locum Profiles, engage with and transact online directly for their Services.</p><p>Shift&#x27;M also assists with the collection of Locum revenues from Clients.</p><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor" id="is-shiftm-a-labour-broker"></a><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="hash-link" href="#is-shiftm-a-labour-broker" title="Direct link to heading">#</a>Is Shift&#x27;M a Labour Broker?</h3><p>No, Shift&#x27;M is a web-based platform that facilitates direct contact and transactions between Clients and Locums for the purchase of Locum services. We do not employ Locums, nor do we create the expectation of employment. We further, do not create any expectations of employment between Clients and Locums. Locums and Clients accept this upfront by accepting and our Terms and Conditions of using Shift&#x27;M.</p><p>Shift&#x27;M acts as Payment Agent between client and locum.</p><p>Shift&#x27;M does not in any way represent that a locum will be treated as or qualify as employee or will benefit from any employee rights or protections whatsoever now or in the future from locum work secured from Clients on or through Shift&#x27;M.</p><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor" id="a-note-on-taxation"></a><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="hash-link" href="#a-note-on-taxation" title="Direct link to heading">#</a>A note on Taxation</h3><p>Income tax, VAT and other levies may apply to locum either as sole proprietors or through their corporate entities through which they contract. Locum may be entitled to apply at their own instance or at the request of or through the Client, to the tax authorities for tax directives and supply these to Clients.</p><p>Shift&#x27;M does not express, imply or adopt any opinion on tax-related conditions that may apply to Locums or Clients or between Locums and Clients. Both Locums and Clients should seek their own advice on all tax-related issues and especially on the nature of the relationship between Locum and Client that pertains to their specific Locum / Client circumstances.</p><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor" id="shiftm-terms--conditions"></a><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="hash-link" href="#shiftm-terms--conditions" title="Direct link to heading">#</a>Shift&#x27;M Terms &amp; Conditions</h3><p>The following terms and conditions govern your access to and use of the Shift&#x27;M platform, including any content, functionality and services offered on or through <a href="http://www.shiftm.com">www.shiftm.com</a> (the ‘Platform’).</p><p>Please read the Terms &amp; Conditions carefully before you start using the platform.</p><p>By using the platform, registering as a user, opening an account or by clicking that you accept or agree to our Terms &amp; Conditions when this option is made available to you, you fully accept and agree to be bound by and abide by our Terms &amp; Conditions (and all updates) and our Privacy Policy, found here incorporated herein by reference.
