### Completed Transactions


Once you are logged in, go to your <a href={"https://www.shiftm.com/user/transaction"}>transaction history</a>.

Here you can see and export all bookings and Shifts that have been completed and the status of the payout.
You can see if you have received the money for the shift or if it's still pending.

### Future Transections

Want to know what you will be earning?

On the Future Transactions tab you can see all of the future earnings for either all of your listings or for each individual listing.

Future transactions are for all confirmed bookings that you have accepted. If a booking is cancelled, it will no longer appear on the list.
