### Finding your Booking


Once you are logged in, go to your <a href={"https://www.shiftm.com/bookings/current"}>bookings</a>.

You can only cancel upcoming Shifts. Past Shift's cannot be cancelled.

### Refund

Once the booking has been cancelled by the locum, a refund will automatically be issued back to the client.

If the client cancels the booking, it is subject to the cancellation policy set by the locum. The cancellation policy of
the locum can be found on their listing.

Ensure you are familiar with the <a href={"https://www.shiftm.com/cancellation-policies/"}>cancellation policy</a>.
