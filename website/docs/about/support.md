### We’re here if you need us
Our global team is standing by 24/7 to help make things right with booking or Shift assistance, refunds, reimbursements and our verification process.

Just reach out if there’s anything you need.

#### Contacting Us

If there are any questions regarding this privacy policy, please <a href={"mailto:support@shiftm.com"}>email</a> or <a href={"https://shiftm.com/contact"}>contact</a> us.


#### Safety
Your Shift'M experience begins the moment you interact with our service. That’s only possible when you trust this community and feel safe. As a result, we require that you refrain from endangering or threatening anyone.

##### Harming yourself or others
You should not commit physical or sexual assault, sexual abuse, sexual harassment, domestic violence, robbery, human trafficking, other acts of violence, or hold anyone against their will. Members of dangerous organizations, including terrorist, organized criminal, and violent racist groups, are not welcome in this community. Shift'M is committed to working with law enforcement as appropriate and responding to valid law enforcement requests.

We take suicide, self-injury, eating disorders, and hard drug abuse extremely seriously and work to help people in crisis.

##### Threatening anyone
You should not convey an intent to harm anyone by your words or physical actions. We also take threats of self-harm as seriously as we do actions and may intervene if we become aware of a threat.

##### Creating hazardous situations
You should not keep unsecured weapons, disease risks, or dangerous items in your place of work, nor should you create conditions that increase the likelihood of a fire or impede escape in the event of emergency.

##### Security
Our Shift'M community members share their business, clients, and services. Whether you’re opening your business as a client or providing a service as a locum, you should trust that you will feel secure. We ask you to respect others’ property, information, and personal belongings.

#### Theft, vandalism, or extortion
You should not take property that isn’t yours, use someone’s property without their permission, copy others’ keys or identity documents, damage others’ property, or threaten anyone with bad ratings or any other penalty or harm to obtain compensation or other benefits.

##### Spam, phishing, or fraud
You should not make transactions outside of the Shift'M payments system; commit booking fraud, credit card fraud, or launder money; attempt to drive traffic to other sites or market unrelated products; divert payments meant for others; abuse our referrals system; or make false claims against other members of the community.

##### Discriminatory behavior or hate speech
You should treat everyone with respect in every interaction. So, you should follow all applicable laws and not treat others differently because of their race, ethnicity, national origin, religious affiliation, sexual orientation, sex, gender, gender identity, disability, or serious diseases. Similarly, insulting others on these bases is not allowed.

##### What is our Anti-Discrimination Policy?

Bullying or harassing others
You should not share personal information to shame or blackmail others, target others with unwanted behavior, defame others, or violate our review and content standards.

##### Misrepresenting yourself
You should not provide a false name or date of birth, use listings for fraud, maintain duplicate accounts, or create an account if you’re under 18.

##### Misrepresenting your qualifications or work history
You should not provide inaccurate location information, have incorrect availability, mislead people about the type, nature, or details of your experience, substitute one listing for another, set up fake or fraudulent listings, leave fraudulent reviews, engage in deceptive pricing, or fail to disclose hazards and habitability issues.

##### Breaking commitments
Absent extenuating circumstances, you should not cancel after the deadline set in the relevant cancellation policy. You should also not fail to make arrival possible, fail to pay, or be a no show.

##### Being unresponsive
You should not have persistently and pervasively low ratings, be unresponsive during booking or throughout a Shift, or refuse to participate in our resolution process.
