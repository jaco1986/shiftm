### Your safety is our priority


#### Verification Checks
Shift'M verifies all registered locums with their respective professional body. We provide a "verified" check on the users profile to provide security that the locum has the registration to practice. We verify registrations yearly and will remove any "verification" check if registration lapses, is cancelled or removed due to malpractice.

#### Secure Messaging
Our secure messaging tool lets you get to know a client or locum and ask questions about specialities or experience ahead of time. After the locum is booked, you can use it to easily message back-and-forth to coordinate things like arrival procedures and parking.

#### Reviews
If you’re curious about what others thought of a potential locum, client, or experience, all you have to do is look at their reviews. Clients and locums can only review each other after a Shift, so you know the feedback you’re seeing is based on actual experiences.

### Profiles

Everyone on Shift'M has a profile to help other users get to know each other. To book a locum or list as a locum, you’ll be asked to provide Shift'M with your full name, date of birth, phone number, payment information, and email address.

### Secure Payments

Our secure platform ensures your money gets to the locum, that’s why we ask you to always pay through Shift'M and never wire/transfer/EFT money or pay someone directly.

### Account Protection

We take a number of measures to safeguard your Shift'M account, like sending you account alerts when changes are made.


### Scam Prevention

Always pay and communicate directly through the Shift'M website or app. As long as you stay on Shift'M throughout the entire process — from communication, to booking, to payment — you’re protected by our multi-layer defense strategy.

### Community

* Shift'M is a global company, operating in over 12 countries. Shift'M relies on the community to provide accurate information, through reviews, regarding their experiences with other users.
