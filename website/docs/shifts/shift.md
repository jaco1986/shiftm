#### What is a Shift?
Shift's are days that have been booked by a client. A client can create a booking with multiple Shifts, so a Shift is essentially a period per day that you are required to work for a client.

#### How long is a Shift?
The length of a Shift is determined by the client. The client will schedule a locum for a specific time period or Shift period.

#### I don't want to be on Shifts that are longer than 4 hours?
Shift'M provides the functionality for locums to determine when and how they would like to work. This can be set on your Listing.

#### How can I see my previous or completed Shifts?
To find all your previous bookings/shifts:

* Go to Your Shifts
