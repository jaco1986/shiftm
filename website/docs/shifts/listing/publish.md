* Select your Listing
* At the bottom of the screen, you can publish or unpublish your listing

If you donâ€™t want to receive any inquiries or requests, you can unpublish your listing.

#### How do I know if a listing is available?
As long as you enter your required profession, Shift dates, and times when searching on Shift'M, all listings that show should be available.

While we strongly encourage all locums to keep their calendars up to date, consider sending a message to locums to double check that they are still available.
