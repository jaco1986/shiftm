#### How do I create a listing?

* Go to Your Listings on shiftm.com
* Select the Add new listings button
* Follow the steps

Your listing won't be public until you have published your listing. You can only publish your listing once you have completed all of the required information.


#### Can I change my listing name?

* Go to Your Listings on shiftm.com
* Select the listing you want to change
* Next to the listing you want to edit, click Edit
* Select Step 1, then click Change
* Follow the steps

There are a couple of other things to know about editing your listing:

Edits only apply to reservations booked after you make the changes; they don't apply to upcoming reservations that were already accepted.
While you edit, your changes will be automatically saved.
