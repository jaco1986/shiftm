#### What is my hourly rate?
Your hourly rate is what clients will pay for your services per hour.

#### How do I set my hourly rate?
To set your default hourly rate:

* Go to Your listings on shiftm.com
* Select the listing you want to change the price for
* Select Step 3 and following the steps

Any changes you make will only apply to future bookings, and won't affect bookings that are already confirmed.

#### How do I calculate my payout?
The payout youâ€™ll receive is your hourly rate times the number of hours per Shift.
To view information about any of your payouts, visit your Transaction History.

Clients pay a service fee to Shift'M in addition to the cost of your listing, which is why the total price clients see is higher than your payout.


#### Can I change the rate of an existing booking?
No, you cannot change the rate. All bookings that have been accepted would already have been settled with Shift'M.
