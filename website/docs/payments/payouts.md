#### Where do I find my payout information?
You can check the status of your payouts and display detailed information on your earnings at any time from your Transaction History.

You can filter transactions by payout method, listing, and date. Display details of your payouts by clicking the reservation code.

#### Completed transactions
To review payouts that have been released by Shift'M, check out the Completed Payouts tab, where payout rows represent each payout that has been sent to you. Click the payout row to expand any payout, which will show transaction details such as bookings, adjustments, and cancellation fees.

After we release your payout, the arrival time frame depends on the payout method you’ve selected.

If you have multiple listings with reservations that begin on the same day, any payouts going to the same payout method will display as one row, because they were paid out together.

#### Upcoming transactions
To review your upcoming payouts, adjustments, or fees, check out the Upcoming Payouts tab. You’ll see payout rows, which show future release dates. If the payout is still pending.

#### Gross earnings
For each booking, the gross earning amount is the price of the payout total before Shift'M service fees and any taxes collected on your behalf are removed. Earnings will appear in this tab after the payout for that reservation has been released.

#### Exporting to a spreadsheet
You can click Download CSV to download a .csv file of your transactions from any tab. The CSV file can be opened by any standard spreadsheet program (like Microsoft Excel, Google Docs, or Apple Numbers) to give you a display of the data.
