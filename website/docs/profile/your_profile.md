Your profile is a great way for others to learn more about you before they interact with you. When your profile is robust, it helps others feel that you're reliable, authentic, and committed to the community of Shift'M. Whether you're a locum or a client, the more complete your profile is, the more Shifts you're likely to get.

We require all locums to have a profile photo, and most clients upload a profile photo before starting their first booking.

A great profile often includes:
* At least one profile photo that shows your face. Some locums require clients to have a profile photo, but client profile photos are not displayed until after a booking is confirmed.
* Multiple verifications
* A description of at least 50 words highlighting why you decided to join the Shift'M community, or anything else you think someone would want to know.

To view someone's profile, just click their profile avatar or photo.
