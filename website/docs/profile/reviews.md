### General info

#### How do reviews work for Shifts?
All the reviews on Shift'M are written by locums and clients who have completed their Shift using Shift'M. In addition to a written review, clients are also asked to provide star ratings.

You have 14 days after your Shift ends to write a review. To encourage impartial and honest comments, reviews are posted only after both parties have completed their review, or when the 14-day review period has ended.

#### Writing a review
To leave a review for a recent Shift, go to your reviews.

Reviews are limited to 1000 words and must follow Shift'M Review Policy. The best reviews include information that will help future locums and clients. For example, you can share about your interactions with your client, locum, or their affiliates, and you can highlight qualities that that you liked or disliked (like arrival procedure, interactions, or things relating to your Shift).

#### Finding past reviews
To read reviews you've written or reviews about you, go to your reviews.

#### Can I edit a review I wrote?
To encourage honest and impartial reviews, a review cannot be edited.

#### Removing published reviews
If you decide that you'd like to have a review that you wrote unpublished, you can request that by contacting us.

If you request that we remove a review written by someone else, we will only take action if it violates our Review Policy.

#### Can I remove or respond to a review I disagree with?
You can post a public response to reviews that others leave for you, but you can't remove them. Reviews are only removed if they violate our Review Policy

#### Shift'M Review Policy
You can post a public response to reviews that others leave for you, but you can't remove them. Reviews are only removed if they violate our Review Policy

* Reviews should be unbiased.
* Reviews are most helpful when they provide unbiased information.
* You are not allowed to incentivize positive reviews, to use the threat of a negative review to manipulate a desired outcome, or to influence another’s review with the promise of compensation.
* You are also not allowed to accept fake reservations in exchange for a positive review, use a second account to leave yourself a review, or coordinate with business partners to get positive reviews.

#### Reviews should be relevant.
Keep your reviews relevant to Shift'M and your Shift or experience. Other hosts and guests are reading your reviews to learn about the host and listing. Reviews that are off-topic are distracting and don’t help our guests make informed booking decisions. For this reason, reviews should focus on your interactions with other community members and your time during the stay or experience.

#### Reporting a review that violates this policy
To report a review for violating our review policy, contact us.

#### Shift'M Dispute Moderation for Reviews
We believe that a healthy review system is one that respects and protects our community’s genuine feedback. For that reason, we take the removal of any review very seriously.

This means a review will be removed if:

* The review is in violation of the Shift'M Policy
* The review is biased
* The review is irrelevant to the author’s experience on Shift'M
