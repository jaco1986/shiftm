#### How do star ratings work for Shifts?
In addition to written reviews, clients can submit an overall star rating for their locum.

#### Why did I get a review that says I canceled?
If you cancel a reservation as a client, an automated review will be posted to your profile. These reviews are one of the client cancellation penalties and can't be removed.
