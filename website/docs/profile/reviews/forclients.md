#### How long do I have to write a review after a trip has ended?
You have 14 days after Shift ends to write a review.

To see your reservations and reviews:
* Go to Profile on shiftm.com
* Click Reviews
* Select Reviews By You

Because the review system is automated, we’re unable to make any exceptions. If you'd still like to thank your locum or client, or give helpful feedback, you can send them a note using your Shift'M message system.

#### Can I leave a review for my locum if they canceled my reservation?
If the locum cancels a Shift before a day before the Shift start, you won’t have the option to leave a review. Instead, an automatic review will be added to their profile to indicate that they canceled the Shift. These reviews are one of the penalties for cancellations and can’t be removed.
