Messaging on Shift'M starts when a client makes an inquiry or reservation request. Afterward, all messages related to that inquiry or reservation request will appear in your inbox.

You must be logged in to your Shift'M account to read or send messages.

#### To read or send a message
* Go to your Messages
* Select Shifts or Clients
* Click on a message thread to read existing messages or send a new one

#### To remove a message from your inbox
* Go to your Messages
* Select Shifts or Clients
* Hover over the message thread you'd like to remove and select Delete.

#### More details
If a message makes you feel uncomfortable or someone tries to get you to pay outside Shift'M, please let us know.

When you click on a message, you can read the conversation and also find the following info (either on the page if you're on a desktop computer, or by tapping the Details link at the top of the messages if you're using the Shift'M app):

* Host or guest profiles including number of reviews, verifications, and description
* Reservation and payment details such as date of inquiry, number of guests, and price breakdown
* Events such as reservation confirmations, pre-approvals, and special offers that are notated in the timeline of the conversations
* Any actions that are needed from you including booking inquiries or reservation requests (you’ll find a prompt at the top of the page, above the conversation)
* Hosts will also find info about how much the guest is paying and what they will earn, along with a snapshot of their calendar.

#### How do I contact a Locum before booking a reservation?
If you want to find out more about a listing, locum, or their experience before booking, you can message the locum on Shift'M.

To message a locum before making a booking:

On Shift'M.com, go to the listing for the locum you want to contact.
Click Contact Locum on the listing page.
Enter the dates and times for a potential Shift. You can adjust this information before booking.
Write your message and click Send Message.
For your safety and privacy, you can’t call or email a locum before your request is accepted. Learn more about why it’s good to keep communication and transactions on Shift'M.
