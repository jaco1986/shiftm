#### How do I add photos?
You need at least one photo in order to list yourself, we recommend you put up a professional photo of yourself. You are able to add multiple photos, but this is not recommended. Choose your best smile, that should do!

#### Adding a photo
To add photos to an existing listing:

* Go to your Listing
* Select your listing that you would like to change your picture for
* Click Edit
* Go to Step 2 and follow the step

Keep in mind that resolution mattersâ€”take photos that are at least 1024 x 683px. When in doubt, a bigger photo is better.

#### How can I take a great photo of myself?
Your photo should be a clear full face picture of yourself.

Here are some tips for taking high-quality photos:

* Resolution matters: Take photos that are at least 1024 x 683px. When in doubt, a bigger photo is better.
* Take your photos in landscape format: Photos in search results are all displayed in landscape.
* Take photos during the day. More light is always better.
