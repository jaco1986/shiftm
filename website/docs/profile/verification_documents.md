#### What is the verification process?
At Shift'M, we’re always working on making our community as secure as possible for everyone. That’s why, before booking a locum, or becoming a client, we may ask for a government ID or details and proof of your registration. Registration refers to your authority to work as a healthcare professional.

#### How does it work when Shift'M verifies your identity?
Shift'M will require all users to submit a goverment ID when creating a profile. The ID submmited will be checked against the details on their profile as well as matched to their profile picture.

#### How does it work when Shift'M verifies your registration?
Shift'M will require all locums to submit supporting document, like receipts or membership documents, stating their registration number, expirty date and professional body they are registered with. Shift'M will verify these details with the professional body to ensure the locum is a registered healthcare professional and is still allowed to practice.  

Registrations will be checked on a yearly basis to ensure up to date verification.

#### How will clients know if the locums details have been verified?
Shift'M will display a verified check on the locums profile. This will be visible to anyone viewing the profile.

#### What does it mean when someone’s verification has been checked?
It means that Shift'M has verified that the user is currently registered with a professional body and allowed to practice as a healthcare professional.

#### What types of ID are allowed
Depending on your location and what country you’re from, you may be able to add one of the following types of government ID:

* Driver’s license
* Passport
* National identity card

Your ID needs to be an official government-issued ID (not an ID for a school, library, gym, etc.) that includes a photo of you.

If you add a driver’s license, you’ll be asked for two photos—one of the front of the license and one of the back.

If you add a passport, make sure the photo includes the numbers located at the bottom of the page with your picture.

#### Is providing identification to Shift'M secure?
The identification info you provide is governed by our Privacy Policy and transmitted using secure encryption, the same process that websites use to transmit credit card numbers.

When we receive information from your driver's license, passport, or national identity card, we don't store the number, we only verify it, so you should only have to confirm your identity once.

Only authorized Shift'M employees are allowed access to your original documentation for troubleshooting or internal purposes.

#### What are the requirements to interact on Shift'M?
We ask everyone who uses Shift'M for a few pieces of information. Clients need to have this info completely filled out before they can make a booking request. This info helps make sure locums know who they are potentially working for, and how to contact the client.

Shift'M requirements for clients include:

* Full name
* Email address
* Confirmed phone number
* Introductory message
* Agreement to conditions

Clients are encouraged, but not required, to have a profile photo. Locums won’t see client's real email addresses, even after they book.

Some locums may also ask clients to provide ID before booking accepting a Shift.

#### Does Shift'M perform background checks on users?
As discussed above, we currently perform a photo match against the users ID and for locums we verify their registration with their professional body or local government. Shift'M does not perform background checks other than photo checks and registration.
